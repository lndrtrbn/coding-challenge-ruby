# Coding Challenge Ruby

**Coding Challenge Ruby** is a repository that regroups usefull information, algorithms, data structures, etc. to help resolve coding challenge in Ruby.

Each algorithm, data structure, whatever, comes with comments at the beginning of the file to explain in what situation it should be used, to resolve what kind of problem.

> Information are mostly inspired from the very good **geeksforgeeks** website.
