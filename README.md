# Coding Challenge Ruby

**Coding Challenge Ruby** is a repository which groups usefull information, algorithms, data structures, etc. to help resolve coding challenge in Ruby.

Each algorithm, data structure, whatever, comes with comments at the beginning of the file to explain in what situation it could be usefull.

> Information is mostly inspired from the very good **geeksforgeeks** website.
